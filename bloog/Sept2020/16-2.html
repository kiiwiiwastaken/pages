        <p>Back at it again with another post on the same day! This is a bit more about the PSP and such so I hope you find it interesting. :)</p>
        <br>
        <p>So I'm thinking of working on a compatability list for the N64 emulator on the PSP known as Daedalus 64. I have a 128gb memory stick in my psp that also has a ton of n64 roms in it, 99% of which haven't been tested by me, so maybe I'll make a section on my website where I make a compatibilty list on a bunch of games! I won't play all the way through the game, but I'll give first impressions for what you can expect from the game running through the emulator :)</p>
		<br>
        <p>You know what? I'll make it right now with Super Mario 64 as the first game on the compatibility list, be right back (though it won't seem like I left since this is a blog post haha)</p>
        <br>
        <p>And done :p</p>
