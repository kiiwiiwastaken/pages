        <p>Hi everyone! This is my first blog post, so I hope I'm doing this right haha. I think what I'll do is just barf all of my thoughts that are going on right now while I post. I'll redact stuff afterwards if I find it to be too personal so I'm not too revealing :)</p>
        <br>
        <p>Let's see... Well I'm listening to The Black Keys while typing this out, I really like their sound. I wonder if it's just a duo when there are more than 2 instruments in songs. I know they edit all the instruments together but I still find it impressive that they know more than a single instrument! I'm also curious as to how concerts would work? I know that concerts aren't (hopefully) a thing right now due to covid, but do they just have a stereo hooked up with the backup instruments or are there temp people at concerts that use the instruments?? I would look it up right now but I'm too busy typing this out so I just won't right now haha</p>

        <p>[TWO SENTENCES REDACTED DUE TO PERSONAL INFORMATION] I can't wait to get a job. I know people usually don't like their jobs but I find it better than staying home all day. I would try to learn how to code more but I honestly don't do it often unless I'm in the mood for it. My dad saw me coding the other day and asked why don't I get a job since I like coding and I told him that it's because I see this more as a hobby. If I did it as a job I would have deadlines and I'd have to collaborate with others and that means coming with compromises and I honestly don't enjoy doing that. Also, if I did do it as a job I'd most likely start to hate coding as I'd be doing it day after day wether I'm in the mood to do it or not.</p>

        <p>Oh on the topic of coding, I'm writing this all within VSCodium, so that means I'm typing raw html and you get to see it in the glorious dark amber mode! I got the css from a website called <a href="http://tilde.club">tilde.club</a> and I really enjoy how it looks. I know it's very basic, but I think it fits the basic site lol</p>
        <br>
        <p>I think that's gonna be all for this post for now, I'm hoping to regularly updated this at least a couple times a week. See y'all later! ^-^</p>
