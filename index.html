        <h1>Welcome!</h1>
        <p>Hello, my name is Kiiwii (Sometimes known as KiiwiiWasTaken) and this is my website! I don't have much to offer excpet for the few things listed below :)</p>
        <br>
        <h1>About me!</h1>
        <p>I'm a recent high school graduate that's learning how to code in Lua! I also have a facination for the PlayStation Portable as I never owned one when it was popular, so it always kinda eluded me as to what it had to offer. I also really enjoy music mainly alternative and indie rock. They both give me 00s vibes and I don't know why but I like it lol</p>
        <h1>Stuff I have to show :p</h1>
        <p>so here are the few things I have to offer!</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="psp/">My psp homebrew list!</a> This is mainly for myself so I can always redownload the files I need if I ever get multiple PSPs but I have it public so those who wanna find homebrew easily can ^^</li>
            <li><a href="bloog/">My blog!</a> What else do I need to say? It's a blog that I have and I (try) to post regularly!</li>
        </ul>
        <p>And that's all I have so far! I hope you enjoy this site as much as I did making it! Maybe one day I'll have my own domain and have this website a lot bigger than just 7kb lmao</p>
